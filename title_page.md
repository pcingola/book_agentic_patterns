This book was directed and edited by Pablo Cingolani, who defined its structure, scope, and technical direction, and ensured that the content forms a coherent and consistent whole. While much of the text and many of the code examples were primarily produced with the assistance of AI tools, substantial effort was invested in curating, refining, and integrating these materials so that the narrative flows logically, the concepts build on one another, and the code reflects sound engineering practices. The result is not an automated compilation, but a carefully guided and edited work shaped by clear architectural intent and hands-on experience.
