# Database column descriptions

We have a database with the following description:

{db_description}

Given the table schema, provide a concise summary of each column in the table.

- Explain what is the main purpose of each column and what it can be used for.
- Highlight any important aspects, e.g. controlled vocabularies or relationships to other tables.
- Be concise and to the point, remove fluff and filler words.
- MUST be one line. This is supposed to be a comment in a `schema.sql` file for a specific column, so it MUST be one line
