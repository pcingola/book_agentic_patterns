# Endpoint categorization

Given the following API endpoints, group them into logical categories based on their functionality and resources.

- Create clear, descriptive category names (e.g., "User Management", "Product Operations", "Search & Discovery").
- Each endpoint should belong to exactly one category.
- Categories should reflect the domain or resource being operated on.
- Return ONLY a JSON object mapping operation_id to category name, nothing else.

Format:
```json
{{
  "operation_id_1": "Category Name",
  "operation_id_2": "Category Name"
}}
```
