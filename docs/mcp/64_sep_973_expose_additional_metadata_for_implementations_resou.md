## Abstract

This SEP proposes adding two optional fields—`icons` and `websiteUrl`. The `icons` and `websiteUrl` would be added to the `Implementation` schema so that clients can visually identify third-party implementations and link directly to their documentation. The `icons` parameter will also be added to the `Tool`, `Resource` and `Prompt` schemas. While this can be used by both servers and clients for all implementations, we expect it to be used initially for server-provided implementations.

## Motivation

### Current State

Current implementations only expose namespaced metadata, forcing clients to display generic labels with no visual cues.

<img alt="Image" />

### Proposed State

The proposed implementation would allow us to add visual affordances and links to documentation, making it easier to visually identify which servers/clients are providing an implementation e.g. a tool in a slash command interface:

<img alt="Image" />

* **Visual Affordance:** Icons make it immediately clear to users which tool or resource source is in use.
* **Discoverability:** A link to documentation (`websiteUrl`) allows clients to direct users to more information with a single click.

## Rationale

This design builds on prior work in web manifests (MDN) and consolidates community feedback:

* **Consolidation of PRs:** Merges the changes from PR #417 and PR #862 into a single, cohesive enhancement.
* **Flexible Icon Sizes:** Supports multiple icon sizes (e.g., `48x48`, `96x96`, or `any` for vector formats) to accommodate different client UI needs.
* **Optional Fields:** By making both fields optional, existing implementations remain fully compatible.

## Specification

Extend the `Implementation` object as follows:

```typescript theme={null}
/**
 * A url pointing to an icon URL or a base64-encoded data URI
 *
 * Clients that support rendering icons MUST support at least the following MIME types:
 * - image/png - PNG images (safe, universal compatibility)
 * - image/jpeg (and image/jpg) - JPEG images (safe, universal compatibility)
 *
 * Clients that support rendering icons SHOULD also support:
 * - image/svg+xml - SVG images (scalable but requires security precautions)
 * - image/webp - WebP images (modern, efficient format)
 */
export interface Icon {
  /**
   * A standard URI pointing to an icon resource.
   *
   * Consumers MUST takes steps to ensure URLs serving icons are from the
   * same domain as the client/server or a trusted domain.
   *
   * Consumers MUST take appropriate precautions when consuming SVGs as they can contain
   * executable JavaScript
   *
   * @format uri
   */
  src: string;
  /** Optional override if the server’s MIME type is missing or generic. */
  mimeType?: string;
  /** e.g. "48x48", "any" (for SVG), or "48x48 96x96" */
  sizes?: string;
}

/**
 * Describes the MCP implementation
 */
export interface Implementation extends BaseMetadata {
  version: string;
  /**
   * An optional list of icons for this implementation.
   * This can be used by clients to display the implementation in a user interface.
   * Each icon should have a `kind` property that specifies whether it is a data representation or a URL source, a `src` property that points to the icon file or data representation, and may also include a `mimeType` and `sizes` property.
   * The `mimeType` property should be a valid MIME type for the icon file, such as "image/png" or "image/svg+xml".
   * The `sizes` property should be a string that specifies one or more sizes at which the icon file can be used, such as "48x48" or "any" for scalable formats like SVG.
   * The `sizes` property is optional, and if not provided, the client should assume that the icon can be used at any size.
   */
  icons?: Icon[];
  /**
   * An optional URL of the website for this implementation.
   *
   * Consumers MUST takes steps to ensure URLs serving icons are from the
   * same domain as the client/server or a trusted domain.
   *
   * Consumers MUST take appropriate precautions when consuming SVGs as they can contain
   * executable JavaScript
   *
   * @format: uri
   */
  websiteUrl?: string;
}
```

Extend the `Tool`, `Resource` and `Prompt` interfaces with the following type:

```typescript theme={null}
  /**
   * An optional list of icons for a resource.
   * This can be used by clients to display the resource's icon in a user interface.
   * Each icon should have a `kind` property that specifies whether it is a data representation or a URL source, a `src` property that points to the icon file or data representation, and may also include a `mimeType` and `sizes` property.
   * The `mimeType` property should be a valid MIME type for the icon file, such as "image/png" or "image/svg+xml".
   * The `sizes` property should be a string that specifies one or more sizes at which the icon file can be used, such as "48x48" or "any" for scalable formats like SVG.
   * The `sizes` property is optional, and if not provided, the client should assume that the icon can be used at any size.
   */
  icons?: Icon[];
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Both icons and websiteUrl are optional fields; clients that ignore them will fall back to existing behavior.

## Security Implications

This shouldn't introduce any new security implications.
