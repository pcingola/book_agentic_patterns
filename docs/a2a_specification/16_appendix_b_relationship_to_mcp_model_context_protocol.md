## Appendix B. Relationship to MCP (Model Context Protocol)

A2A and MCP are complementary protocols designed for different aspects of agentic systems:

- **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/):** Focuses on standardizing how AI models and agents connect to and interact with **tools, APIs, data sources, and other external resources.** It defines structured ways to describe tool capabilities (like function calling in LLMs), pass inputs, and receive structured outputs. Think of MCP as the "how-to" for an agent to *use* a specific capability or access a resource.
- **Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A):** Focuses on standardizing how independent, often opaque, **AI agents communicate and collaborate with each other as peers.** A2A provides an application-level protocol for agents to discover each other, negotiate interaction modalities, manage shared tasks, and exchange conversational context or complex results. It's about how agents *partner* or *delegate* work.

**How they work together:**
An A2A Client agent might request an A2A Server agent to perform a complex task. The Server agent, in turn, might use MCP to interact with several underlying tools, APIs, or data sources to gather information or perform actions necessary to fulfill the A2A task.

For a more detailed comparison, see the [A2A and MCP guide](./topics/a2a-and-mcp.md).
