## 2. Terminology

### 2.1. Requirements Language

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### 2.2. Core Concepts

A2A revolves around several key concepts. For detailed explanations, please refer to the [Key Concepts guide](./topics/key-concepts.md).

- **A2A Client:** An application or agent that initiates requests to an A2A Server on behalf of a user or another system.
- **A2A Server (Remote Agent):** An agent or agentic system that exposes an A2A-compliant endpoint, processing tasks and providing responses.
- **Agent Card:** A JSON metadata document published by an A2A Server, describing its identity, capabilities, skills, service endpoint, and authentication requirements.
- **Message:** A communication turn between a client and a remote agent, having a `role` ("user" or "agent") and containing one or more `Parts`.
- **Task:** The fundamental unit of work managed by A2A, identified by a unique ID. Tasks are stateful and progress through a defined lifecycle.
- **Part:** The smallest unit of content within a Message or Artifact. Parts can contain text, file references, or structured data.
- **Artifact:** An output (e.g., a document, image, structured data) generated by the agent as a result of a task, composed of `Parts`.
- **Streaming:** Real-time, incremental updates for tasks (status changes, artifact chunks) delivered via protocol-specific streaming mechanisms.
- **Push Notifications:** Asynchronous task updates delivered via server-initiated HTTP POST requests to a client-provided webhook URL, for long-running or disconnected scenarios.
- **Context:** An optional, server-generated identifier to logically group related tasks and messages.
- **Extension:** A mechanism for agents to provide additional functionality or data beyond the core A2A specification.
