# API connection configurations for OpenAPI connector
#
# This file defines API connections that can be used by agents through the OpenAPI connector.
# Each API requires:
# - spec_source: URL or file path to the OpenAPI 3.x specification
# - base_url: Base URL for API requests (overrides the spec's servers section)
#
# The base_url allows environment-specific overrides:
# - Use different URLs for dev/staging/prod environments
# - Point to localhost for local testing even if spec specifies production
# - Override outdated or incorrect server URLs in the spec
# If not specified in config, falls back to the spec's servers[0].url
#
# Environment variables can be used with ${VAR} syntax.
# Relative file paths are resolved relative to this file's directory.
