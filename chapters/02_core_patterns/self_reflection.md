## Self-Reflection

Self-reflection is a reasoning pattern in which an agent explicitly inspects, critiques, and revises its own intermediate reasoning or outputs in order to improve correctness, robustness, or alignment with a goal.

At its core, self-reflection introduces a second-order reasoning step: the agent reasons not only about the task, but also about its own reasoning process or output. Unlike Chain-of-Thought, which focuses on making reasoning explicit, self-reflection adds evaluation and correction as first-class operations.

A typical self-reflection cycle unfolds in several stages. First, the agent produces an initial solution using its standard reasoning process. This solution is then treated as an object of analysis. The agent is prompted, either implicitly or explicitly, to identify flaws, inconsistencies, missing assumptions, or mismatches with the task requirements. Based on this critique, the agent generates a revised solution that incorporates the identified improvements. This cycle may run once or multiple times, depending on the system design.

What distinguishes self-reflection from simple re-prompting is that the critique is grounded in the agent’s own prior output and often structured around explicit criteria, such as correctness, logical consistency, completeness, or adherence to constraints. In more advanced agentic systems, the reflective step can be guided by external signals, including unit tests, environment feedback, or memory of past failures, making reflection both contextual and cumulative.

In agent architectures, self-reflection often appears as a control-loop pattern layered on top of other reasoning strategies. For example, an agent may use Chain-of-Thought to generate a solution, Tree of Thought to explore alternatives, and then self-reflection to select or refine the best candidate. In long-running agents, reflections can be persisted as lessons or heuristics, allowing future behavior to improve without retraining the underlying model. This makes self-reflection a key mechanism for adaptivity and learning-like behavior in otherwise static models.
