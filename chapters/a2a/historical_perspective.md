## Historical Perspectives

The Orchestration chapter traced how multi-agent systems research in the 1980s and 1990s produced agent communication languages -- KQML, FIPA ACL -- that standardized the structure and semantics of inter-agent messages. Those early standards were conceptually influential but operationally heavy. They assumed relatively structured symbolic agents operating in research environments, and they predated the ubiquitous web stack that now underlies virtually all networked software. The 2020s reintroduced the need for inter-agent interoperability under fundamentally different constraints. LLM-based agents are often deployed as services behind HTTP endpoints. They must cooperate across vendor and organizational boundaries. They increasingly manage long-running tasks that produce artifacts worth persisting, forwarding, and auditing. Modern web primitives (HTTPS for transport, JSON for serialization, JSON-RPC 2.0 for request framing) make it practical to standardize inter-agent communication without requiring a shared runtime or cognitive architecture.

A2A is best understood as a pragmatic continuation of this decades-long line of work. Rather than attempting to standardize internal reasoning or cognitive semantics, as earlier protocols often did, A2A standardizes the external contract: how agents discover each other, how they initiate and track units of work, how they exchange messages during execution, and how they deliver outputs in a predictable format. This narrower scope makes A2A implementable across diverse agent frameworks while preserving the interoperability vision that motivated KQML and FIPA ACL a generation earlier.
