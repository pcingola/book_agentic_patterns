## Introduction

The Orchestration chapter introduced A2A as a coordination pattern in which autonomous agents interact through a shared protocol to delegate work and compose behavior. This chapter examines the protocol itself: its data model, task lifecycle, observation mechanisms, and security model.

A2A (Agent2Agent) is an application-layer protocol that standardizes how autonomous agents discover each other, exchange messages, and coordinate work as tasks over HTTP(S), using JSON-RPC 2.0 envelopes. The remote agent is intentionally treated as opaque: A2A does not prescribe how it plans, calls tools, or maintains internal state. What it prescribes is how the client creates and advances work, and how the remote agent reports progress and returns outputs in a predictable, interoperable format. This makes A2A suitable for delegation patterns where a coordinator discovers specialized agents, selects one based on declared capabilities, and initiates and tracks a task without needing a shared framework.

A2A and MCP are complementary layers rather than competing protocols. MCP standardizes how agents interact with tools and resources; A2A standardizes how agents interact with other agents as autonomous peers. A common composition is A2A for delegation (coordinator to specialist) and MCP for tool-use (specialist to databases, file systems, sandboxes). The chapter begins with the task lifecycle, then covers the full protocol data model and operations in detail, and concludes with security.
