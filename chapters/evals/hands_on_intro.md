# Hands-On: Introduction

The hands-on sections that follow demonstrate a layered approach to validating agentic systems, progressing from deterministic testing through evaluation frameworks to automated quality analysis. Each layer addresses a different aspect of the testing and evaluation challenge: controlling non-determinism, measuring output quality, scaling evaluation infrastructure, and assessing the quality of the components themselves.

Deterministic testing shows how to replace the inherently stochastic model with controlled mocks, enabling exact assertions on agent behavior without network calls or API costs. ModelMock provides predefined responses, while tool_mock controls tool outputs and tracks invocation patterns. This approach validates agent logic and tool integration with the precision of traditional unit tests, complementing rather than replacing model-level evaluation.

The basic evals section introduces three fundamental evaluation techniques: string matching for factual queries with known answers, structured outputs that constrain the model to return typed values for easier assertion, and LLM-as-a-Judge for open-ended tasks where correctness is semantic rather than syntactic. The Pydantic Evals framework builds on these foundations by providing structured abstractions (Cases, Evaluators, Datasets) that transform ad-hoc tests into maintainable, scalable evaluation suites with metadata for slicing results and structured reports for comparison across system variants.

The final section introduces Doctors, AI-powered analyzers that evaluate the quality of prompts, tools, MCP server definitions, A2A agent cards, and Agent Skills. Where evals assess whether an agent produces correct outputs, doctors assess whether the components that define an agent are well-specified in the first place. Poorly defined tools force models to guess about expected inputs; vague prompts produce inconsistent behavior. Doctors catch these issues before they manifest as evaluation failures, completing the quality assurance loop from component definition through system behavior.
