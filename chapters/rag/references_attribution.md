## Attribution, Citation, Provenance, and Truth Maintenance

Attribution in RAG systems concerns the ability to explicitly link generated statements to the source documents, data items, and transformations that produced them.

#### Conceptual overview

In a RAG system, attribution spans the entire information flow. Documents are ingested, transformed, chunked, embedded, retrieved, possibly re-ranked, and finally used as conditioning context for generation. Each of these steps introduces opportunities to lose or blur the connection between an output token and its original source. Attribution mechanisms aim to preserve this connection explicitly.

Closely related but distinct concepts are often conflated. *Attribution* answers the question “which source supports this statement?”. *Citation* is the presentation layer, deciding how that source is exposed to users (for example, inline references or footnotes). *Provenance tracking* is the internal bookkeeping that records how data flowed through the system. *Truth maintenance* addresses how these links remain valid over time as documents, embeddings, or models change.

A robust RAG system treats these as complementary layers rather than a single feature.

#### Attribution in RAG generation

At generation time, attribution typically operates at the level of retrieved chunks rather than entire documents. Each chunk carries stable identifiers and metadata inherited from ingestion. During retrieval, these identifiers are preserved and propagated alongside the text content. The generator is then constrained or guided to associate generated statements with one or more of these chunk identifiers.

A common pattern is to structure the model output so that answers and sources are produced together. This reduces ambiguity and allows downstream validation.

```python
# Conceptual output schema used by the generator
{
    "answer": "The BRCA1 gene is involved in DNA repair.",
    "sources": [
        {"doc_id": "oncology_review_2019", "chunk_id": "p3_c2"},
        {"doc_id": "genetics_textbook", "chunk_id": "ch5_c7"}
    ]
}
```

Even when the language model is free-form, the system can post-process token spans and align them with the retrieved chunks that were present in context. The key requirement is that attribution identifiers remain machine-readable and stable across the pipeline.

#### References and citation strategies

Citation is the user-facing expression of attribution. In RAG systems, citation strategies range from coarse to fine-grained. Some systems attach a single list of documents supporting the entire answer. More advanced designs provide sentence-level or clause-level citations, which improves trust and debuggability but requires tighter coupling between generation and retrieval.

A critical design choice is whether citations are generated by the model or imposed by the system. Model-generated citations are flexible but error-prone, while system-enforced citations trade fluency for correctness. In practice, hybrid approaches are common: the system restricts the citation candidates to retrieved chunks, and the model selects among them.

#### Provenance tracking across the pipeline

Provenance tracking is not limited to the final answer. It begins at ingestion and continues through retrieval and generation. Each transformation step should preserve or enrich provenance metadata rather than overwrite it.

A minimal provenance record typically includes the original document identifier, version information, chunk boundaries, and timestamps. More advanced systems also track the embedding model version, retrieval parameters, and re-ranking decisions. This allows engineers to answer questions such as whether an incorrect answer was caused by stale data, poor retrieval, or model behavior.

```python
# Example of a provenance record attached to a retrieved chunk
provenance = {
    "doc_id": "clinical_guidelines_v2",
    "doc_version": "2024-06-15",
    "chunk_id": "sec4_para1",
    "embedding_model": "text-embedding-v3",
    "retrieval_score": 0.87
}
```

Such records are rarely exposed to end users, but they are essential for auditing, debugging, and offline evaluation.

#### Truth maintenance in evolving RAG systems

Truth maintenance addresses the fact that RAG systems are not static. Documents are updated, embeddings are recomputed, and models are replaced. Without explicit mechanisms, previously correct attributions can silently become invalid.

One approach is versioned provenance. Every answer is associated not just with a document identifier, but with a specific document version and ingestion timestamp. When the underlying data changes, the system can detect that an answer depends on outdated sources and either invalidate it or trigger regeneration.

Another approach borrows ideas from classical truth maintenance systems, where derived facts are linked to their supporting assumptions. When an assumption changes, all dependent conclusions are marked for review. In RAG, the “assumptions” correspond to retrieved chunks and their content. This framing is particularly useful in regulated or high-stakes domains, where stale answers are unacceptable.

#### Practical implications

Attribution, provenance, and truth maintenance are often treated as optional add-ons in early RAG prototypes. In production systems, they quickly become essential. They enable explainability, support compliance requirements, and make systematic evaluation possible. More importantly, they turn RAG from a black-box augmentation trick into a transparent information system whose outputs can be inspected, trusted, and improved over time.
