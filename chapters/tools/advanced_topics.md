## Advanced topics

Advanced tool use is where an agent stops being a "function caller" and becomes a supervised, adaptive system: it can ask for approval, reshape its toolset at runtime, defer execution across boundaries, and diagnose or repair its own tool interface.

### Human in the loop for tools

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) for tool use is not just “ask the user sometimes.” It is a deliberate control surface that converts high-impact tool invocations into *reviewable* requests. The key is to treat certain tool calls as *proposed actions* that require explicit approval (or additional input) before execution.

In practice, HITL is most valuable when tools have one or more of these properties:

* **Irreversible side effects** (sending messages, placing orders, writing to production systems).
* **Security/privacy risk** (exfiltration, access-controlled data, broad queries that could leak context).
* **High cost** (compute, paid APIs, long-running jobs).
* **Ambiguity** (the model’s intent is plausible but underspecified).

A common pattern is *policy-based gating*: decide at runtime whether a proposed tool call can run automatically, must be approved, or must be denied/rewritten.

```python
def requires_approval(tool_name: str, args: dict) -> bool:
    # High-risk tools always require review
    if tool_name in {"send_email", "post_to_slack", "execute_sql", "deploy"}:
        return True
    # Risk-based gating on arguments
    if tool_name == "execute_sql" and ("DROP" in args.get("query", "").upper()):
        return True
    if tool_name == "web_search" and args.get("query_scope") == "broad":
        return True
    return False
```

When approval is required, the agent should emit a structured “tool request” that is easy to review: tool name, arguments, rationale, expected side effects, and a rollback story (if any). The approval channel can also support *human steering*: the reviewer edits arguments, adds constraints, or supplies missing context, then resumes the run.

HITL is increasingly described as a first-class mechanism in agent frameworks, where certain tool calls can be flagged for approval based on context or arguments. [29]

### Dynamic tools

“Dynamic tools” means the agent’s available tool interface is not static. Instead, the system can **filter, modify, or augment** tool definitions *at each step* based on context, policy, user role, runtime state, or the current phase of a plan. Conceptually, this is a *tool shaping* step inserted between “decide next action” and “call a tool.”

Common uses:

* **Contextual minimization:** only expose tools relevant to the current subtask (reduces tool confusion and prompt/tool overhead).
* **Progressive disclosure:** start with safe read-only tools; unlock write tools only after a validated plan.
* **Capability routing:** swap tool backends based on tenant, region, permissions, or latency.
* **Argument hardening:** inject guardrails (rate limits, scopes, allowlists) into schemas or tool metadata.

```python
def prepare_tools(all_tools: list, state: dict) -> list:
    phase = state.get("phase", "explore")

    # In exploration, restrict to read-only tools.
    if phase == "explore":
        return [t for t in all_tools if t.meta.get("side_effects") == "none"]

    # In execution, allow write tools but only if a plan was approved.
    if phase == "execute" and state.get("plan_approved") is True:
        return all_tools

    # Default: safest subset.
    return [t for t in all_tools if t.meta.get("risk") in {"low"}]
```

This pattern is explicitly supported in modern tool systems as an agent-wide hook to filter/modify tool definitions step-by-step. [26]

### Deferred tools

Deferred tools separate *selection* of a tool call from *execution* of that tool call. The agent can propose one or more tool invocations, then **pause** and return a bundle of “deferred requests.” Execution happens later—possibly by a human reviewer, an external worker, or a different trust zone—after which the run resumes with the corresponding results.

This is the cleanest way to model:

* HITL approvals (human approves/denies, maybe edits arguments).
* Long-running jobs (async execution).
* Cross-environment execution (agent in a restricted environment, tool runs elsewhere).
* Compliance boundaries (execution requires audit logging, ticketing, or dual control).

The core contract is an *idempotent continuation*: the agent pauses with structured requests, then resumes with structured results, maintaining stable call identifiers so results can be matched to requests.

```python
# Run 1: agent proposes actions but does not execute them.
deferred = agent.run_until_deferred(user_goal)

# deferred.calls: [{id, tool_name, args, rationale, risk_level}, ...]

approved_results = []
for call in deferred.calls:
    decision = human_review(call)  # approve/deny/edit
    if decision.approved:
        result = execute_tool(call.tool_name, decision.args)
        approved_results.append({"id": call.id, "result": result})
    else:
        approved_results.append({"id": call.id, "error": "denied"})

# Run 2: resume with results, continuing the same trajectory.
final = agent.resume_with_results(history=deferred.history, results=approved_results)
```

This "pause with requests → resume with results" mechanism is described directly in deferred-tool documentation. [27]

### Tool doctor (development-time focus)

A *tool doctor* is a development-cycle mechanism used to analyze tool definitions and produce concrete recommendations for improvement **before** those tools are exposed to a running agent. Its goal is preventive rather than reactive: to eliminate ambiguous, underspecified, or misleading tool contracts that would otherwise manifest as failures, retries, or incorrect behavior at runtime.

From an architectural perspective, many issues attributed to “model errors” are in fact interface errors. Poorly chosen tool names, vague descriptions, inconsistent argument schemas, unclear return types, or undocumented side effects all increase the cognitive load on the model and reduce the reliability of tool selection and invocation. A tool doctor treats tool definitions as first-class artifacts that deserve the same scrutiny as APIs or library interfaces in traditional software engineering.

In the development cycle, the tool doctor is typically run as part of tool authoring or integration, alongside tests and schema validation. It inspects each tool definition and evaluates it against a set of qualitative criteria: whether the name accurately reflects behavior, whether the description is sufficiently explicit for an LLM to reason about usage, whether arguments are well-typed and semantically clear, and whether return values and side effects are properly documented. The output is a structured set of recommendations that developers can act on directly.

Conceptually, this is closer to *linting* or *design review* than to runtime monitoring. The emphasis is on improving contracts, not executing tools. A minimal interaction loop looks like this:

```python
# Development-time analysis
tools = load_tool_definitions()
recommendations = run_tool_doctor(tools)

for r in recommendations:
    if r.severity in {"warn", "critical"}:
        apply_fix(r)
```

A well-designed tool doctor batches tools to stay within context limits, ignores well-defined or irrelevant tools, and focuses on non-trivial improvements. This batching is not an optimization detail but a design constraint: tool doctors are meant to be run repeatedly during development, and they must scale to tool libraries with hundreds or thousands of entries.

A key design choice is that recommendations are *structured*, not free-form text. By emitting typed findings—tool name, issue category, severity, and suggested changes—the tool doctor enables downstream automation. Recommendations can be surfaced in CI pipelines, turned into pull request comments, or even applied semi-automatically to regenerate improved tool schemas.

```python
ToolRecommendation(
    tool_name="search_documents",
    severity="warn",
    issue="Description underspecified",
    recommendation="Clarify expected input scope and ranking behavior",
    example_patch="Search indexed documents by keyword with optional filters..."
)
```

Although it is possible to apply similar diagnostics to runtime logs, this should be understood as an extension rather than the primary role of a tool doctor. The canonical use is *pre-runtime*: improving tools so that agents encounter fewer ambiguities, require fewer retries, and operate within clearer safety and capability boundaries.

In short, the tool doctor belongs squarely in the development loop. It formalizes a practice that experienced teams already follow informally—reviewing and refining tool interfaces—but adapts it to the unique demands of language-model-driven agents, where the “caller” is probabilistic and highly sensitive to interface quality.

### Putting the pieces together

Advanced tool use is best understood as a *control architecture* around the basic tool loop:

1. **Prepare toolset (dynamic tools):** expose only relevant/safe tools for this step. [26]
2. **Model proposes tool calls:** possibly multiple calls in a plan.
3. **Gate execution (HITL policy):** auto-run safe calls; defer risky calls for approval. [29]
4. **Pause/resume (deferred tools):** return structured requests; later resume with structured results. [27]
5. **Diagnose and improve (tool doctor):** if failures recur, repair the tool contract (and optionally code), then re-run.

This combination preserves autonomy where it is safe and cheap, while providing strong guarantees—reviewability, auditability, and controllable side effects—where it matters.
