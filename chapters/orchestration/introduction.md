## Introduction

A single agent with tools can accomplish a great deal, but many real-world tasks require coordinating multiple steps, multiple agents, or both. A content pipeline needs sequential stages. A document review needs conditional loops. A research task needs delegation to specialists. These coordination needs cannot be addressed by adding more tools to a single agent -- they require explicit structure around how work flows between components.

This chapter examines the patterns for structuring that flow. Workflows define explicit sequences of agent stages with typed hand-offs between them. Graphs generalize workflows into state machines with conditional edges, branching, and cycles, making control flow inspectable and debuggable. The chapter also covers long-running tasks and asynchronous execution for work that cannot complete in a single request-response cycle, and event-driven agents that react to external signals rather than following a predetermined path. A2A is introduced here as the inter-agent communication standard; it receives its own dedicated chapter later. The hands-on exercises demonstrate these patterns in practice, including delegation and hand-off scenarios where a parent agent routes work to specialized agents.
